                <p>Zack Snyder's Justice League, often referred to as the "Snyder Cut," is the 2021 director's cut of the 2017 American superhero film Justice League. It presents Justice League—the fifth film of the DC Extended Universe (DCEU), the follow-up
                    to Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, and based on the DC Comics superhero team of the same name—as director Zack Snyder had intended it before he left the production. Like the theatrical release, Zack Snyder's Justice League follows
                    the Justice League—Batman (Ben Affleck), Superman (Henry Cavill), Wonder Woman (Gal Gadot), Cyborg (Ray Fisher), Aquaman (Jason Momoa), and the Flash (Ezra Miller)—as they attempt to save the world from the catastrophic threat of Darkseid
                    (Ray Porter), Steppenwolf (Ciarán Hinds), and their army of Parademons.

        <p>ZSJL is an absolute masterpiece...This film is everything that a DC fan ever dreamed of . Visually stunning and narratively satisfying from start to finish, it is not just best DCEU film of all time but also one of the best superhero film of all
            time...Joss whedon should be burned alive for butchering this masterpiece and ruining Snyder's vision in 2017..But true fans loves Snyder's epic vision for DCEU that's why they called out for this film in after whedon's disaster..Zack snyder
            delivered a perfect superhero film here,filled with some of the best visuals ever seen in a movie, eye popping effects, stunning cinematography, eargasmic soundtrack by junkie XL and breathtaking action scenes ZSJL is everything you ever hoped
            for and even more then it looks initially..This film proved again that Ben affleck and Henry cavill are best Batman and Superman of all time..Jared Leto as joker steals the show, steppenwolf is monster looking warrior from other world who
            just wants to invade earth for his own personal reasons, darkseid is an evil tyrant lurking in shadows of different side of universe..This film also works as an origin story for cyborg, he is struggling to find his place in the world torn
            apart between his human and mechanical identity... Batman became a hero again after spending years in rage and hate ,here he is a hero and leader who is honouring Superman after his death via defending this world, the killer vengeful version
            from BvS is long gone.. wonder woman is helping humanity and continuing her duty to defend the world.. flash is trying to be a hero who wants to help people and still learning about his powers...aquaman is also struggling between his human
            life and atlantean heritage as a king, and finally heart and soul of DC Superman...In mos we've seen an alien trying to find his place in the world,in BvS we've seen a conflicted hero who is struggling and finding how to be a hero.but in ZSJL
            we've seen a true Superman who finally became a hero and ultimate protector of earth .An ideal to strive towards...Even side characters like Lois,Martha,Silas,desaad,martian manhunter, joker got small but meaningful part...At last I just want
            to say this is the movie we've been waiting for our life....If you don't loved this movie don't call yourself as a DC fan....It's time to restore the snyderverse now because without ZACK SNYDER and a complete JUSTICE LEAGUE TRILOGY DCEU is
            nothing and will fail soon again...Only a full snyderverse on HBO max can save DC now.... Go watch it and get ready for a lifetime experience... 10/10. A+</p>
